  description: In order to promote the recognition of AI and ML as the most important tools for the future, TU Graz has established the Graz Center for Machine Learning research network. Interdisciplinary work is currently being carried out here to support the further development of machine learning, whether this support enables us to draw efficient and meaningful conclusions from Big Data, to identify the best combination of materials, or to make the systems themselves just a bit smarter.

- title: Bilateral AI
  subtitle: FWF Cluster of Excellence
  image: images/BilAI_logo.png
  link: https://www.bilateral-ai.net/home
  description: The project “Bilateral AI” aims at lifting artificial intelligence (AI) to the next level. Current AI systems are in a sense narrow. They center on a specific application or task such as object or speech recognition. This Austrian-wide Cluster of Excellence will combine two of the most important types of AI which have been developed separately so far: symbolic and sub-symbolic AI. While symbolic AI works with clearly defined logical rules, sub-symbolic AI (such as ChatGPT) is based on training a machine with the help of large datasets to create intelligent behavior. This integration, resulting in a Broad AI, is intended to mirror something that humans do naturally: the simultaneous use of cognition and reasoning skills.
