  description: The project “Bilateral AI” aims at lifting artificial intelligence (AI) to the next level. Current AI systems are in a sense narrow. They center on a specific application or task such as object or speech recognition. Our project will combine two of the most important types of AI which have been developed separately so far: symbolic and sub-symbolic AI. While symbolic AI works with clearly defined logical rules, sub-symbolic AI (such as ChatGPT) is based on training a machine with the help of large datasets to create intelligent behavior. This integration, resulting in a Broad AI, is intended to mirror something that humans do naturally: the simultaneous use of cognition and reasoning skills.
