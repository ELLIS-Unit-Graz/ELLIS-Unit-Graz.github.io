  description: In order to promote the recognition of AI and ML as the most important tools for the future, TU Graz has established the Graz Center for Machine Learning. We support the further development of Machine Learning with interdisciplinary research, whether this support enables us to draw efficient and meaningful conclusions from Big Data, to identify the best combination of materials, or to make the systems themselves just a bit smarter.

  description: The Austrian-wide Cluster of Excellence “Bilateral AI” aims at lifting artificial intelligence (AI) to the next level. It will combine two of the most important types of AI which have been developed separately so far, symbolic and sub-symbolic AI. This integration, resulting in a Broad AI, is intended to mirror something that humans do naturally, the simultaneous use of cognition and reasoning skills.
