# ELLIS Unit Graz

**Note:** This website is currently under construction and will be filled within the coming months. 

At the **ELLIS Unit Graz** we focus on high-level fundamental machine learning research. Our researchers are located across the Graz University of Technology [(TU Graz)](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home). 
The Ellis Unit Graz has strong links with other scientific disciplines through the tight coupling with the Graz Center for Machine Learning [(GraML)](https://www.tugraz.at/en/research/research-at-tu-graz/research-centers/graz-center-for-machine-learning/) and collaborations with various industry partners.
