# ELLIS Unit Graz 

The **ELLIS Unit Graz** advances foundational machine learning research in the fields of Brain-inspired ML, Resource-efficient Deep Learning, Human-centred Computing, Trustworthy AI, Visual Computing, and Probabilistic ML. 

Our **mission** is to develop an in-depth understanding of the contemporary ML systems, and to create methods that are principled, efficient, and practically applicable across domains. In our unit we focus on talent development, foster interdisciplinary collaboration with other scientific disciplines and keep strong connections to industry.

By combining rigorous scientific methodology with industrial and societal relevance, the unit drives innovations in AI technologies that are robust, interpretable, and impactful, reinforcing Europe’s machine learning leadership.

Our researchers are located across the Graz University of Technology [(TU Graz)](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home). The Ellis Unit Graz has strong links with other scientific disciplines through the tight coupling with the Graz Center for Machine Learning [(GraML)](https://www.tugraz.at/en/research/research-at-tu-graz/research-centers/graz-center-for-machine-learning/), the involvement in the Cluster of Excellence [Bilateral AI](https://www.bilateral-ai.net/home) of the Austrian Science Fund, and collaborations with various industry partners.

The ELLIS Unit Graz is also a member of [ELSA](https://elsa-ai.eu/) - the European Lighthouse on Secure and Safe AI.
