This reading group examines the interplay between the **theoretical foundations of deep learning** and the **practical challenge of making machine learning efficient**. It offers researchers at all levels a platform for an open dialog to foster collaboration and discuss fresh research findings published as a pre-print or recently presented at research venues. Approx. every other **Monday @ 5pm CET** / 11am EST / 8am PST

Together with the [ELLIS Unit Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/afdelingen/interdisciplinair/ellis-unit), we hosted a highly engaging workshop at the **ELLIS UnConference** kicking-off **EurIPS 2025** on December 2, 2025 in Copenhagen. We heard about high-level research in this emerging field, discussed innovations that pave the way for efficient AI systems, and thought about how ELLIS can contribute to creating a sustainable European AI ecosystem.

We attended the ELLIS coordinator's retreat from October 6-8, 2025, hosted by the **ELLIS Units Nijmegen, Delft and Amsterdam**. We're happy to have learned so much from other coordinators and strenghtened research management collaborations within the ELLIS network.
