Associate Professor at the Institute of Technical Informatics at TU Graz

Group leader Embedded Learning and Sensing Systems

My research focuses on efficient machine learning and the design of practical AI-based systems at the intersection of deep learning and embedded systems. I am interested in both the theoretical foundations of deep learning optimization for resource-constrained devices and their practical applications in real-world systems.
