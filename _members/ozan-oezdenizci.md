I am an Assistant Professor in the Institute of Machine Learning and Neural Computation at Graz University of Technology, Austria.

My research aims to address robustness, safety, and resource-efficiency of machine learning. I am mainly working on parsimonious and efficient deep learning algorithms that integrate security and privacy considerations to build reliable AI systems. These methods are widely applicable for learning-based computing across various domains, such as computer vision, autonomously learning systems, and neural engineering.
